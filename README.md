# Textract

## Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to upload PDF files, submit custom queries, and get answers using an embedded AI model. The application features:
- PDF preview: Users can see the uploaded PDF on the left side of the page.
- Query processing: Users can input their own queries or select from generated questions, which are then processed to extract relevant information from the uploaded PDF.
- Firebase Authentication: User authentication is integrated to manage login/logout.
- Data storage: Queries, generated questions, and answers are handled and displayed in a visually appealing UI, with some Firebase support for user data.

## Features
- PDF Upload: Users can upload any PDF file, which will be displayed for preview.
- Query Submission: Users can submit multiple queries, and the AI will attempt to answer them based on the PDF content.
- Generated Questions: Automatically generated questions from the document for ease of use.
- Answer Embeddings: Visual representation of embedding data related to the answers.
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication is used for secure login and logout functionality.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Flask (for processing PDF files), Firebase
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication
- Database: Firebase Firestore (for storing user data)
